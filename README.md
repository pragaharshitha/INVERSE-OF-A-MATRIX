# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1:  import numpy as np
### Step 2:  Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
### Step 3:  using the np.linalg.inv(), we can find the inverse of a matrix
### Step 4:  end the program

## Program:
```python
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:pragaharshitha 
#RegisterNumber:22003209
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
B = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(B)
```
## Output:
![](/inverse%20of%20the%20matrix.png)
## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
